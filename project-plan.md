# Project Implementation Plan

## Documentation Integrity Guidelines

**MANDATORY**: This document is subject to strict documentation integrity requirements:

1. **Never Delete Unimplemented Items**: Plan items that have not yet been implemented must NEVER be deleted from this document.
2. **Limited-Scope Updates**: Only update sections directly related to your specific changes.
3. **Preserve Project Roadmap**: The full project roadmap must be maintained regardless of implementation status.
4. **Maintain Historical Context**: Previous planning decisions must be preserved for reference and continuity.
5. **Incremental Updates Only**: Add new information incrementally rather than replacing existing content.

These requirements ensure that the project plan remains a comprehensive roadmap and historical record. Removing planned but unimplemented features from documentation is strictly prohibited as it compromises project integrity.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Quality First**: Prioritize code quality, test coverage, and robust error handling
2. **Modular Design**: Create loosely coupled, highly cohesive components
3. **Documentation-Driven Development**: Document APIs and functionality before implementation
4. **Secure By Design**: Integrate security considerations at every level
5. **User-Centric**: Design all features with the end-user experience in mind
6. **Scalable Architecture**: Build for future growth and increasing data volumes

---

## Testing Philosophy

Each module, feature, and component will undergo thorough testing before moving to the next implementation phase. Our testing approach includes:

1. **Unit Testing**: Testing individual functions and methods (100% coverage for critical components)
2. **Integration Testing**: Testing interactions between components
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Testing complete user workflows
4. **Performance Testing**: Testing response times and throughput
5. **Security Testing**: Validating security controls and identifying vulnerabilities
6. **Documentation**: Creating test documentation for each component

Only after a component passes its test suite will we proceed to the next implementation phase. This ensures system stability and prevents cascading issues that might be more difficult to resolve later.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Logging and Observability

All components must implement a standardized logging approach with the following characteristics:

1. **Centralized Logger Configuration**
   - Service-specific logger with consistent formatting
   - Environment-based log levels (debug in development, info in production)
   - Both console and file output with appropriate rotation
   - Structured JSON format with standardized fields

2. **Mandatory Context Information**
   - Service name and version
   - Module and function name
   - Request ID for cross-service correlation
   - Timestamp with millisecond precision
   - Environment information

3. **Function Instrumentation**
   - Entry/exit logging for all significant functions
   - Parameter and return value logging (with sanitization)
   - Performance timing for operations exceeding 100ms
   - Stack traces for all errors

4. **Error Handling Integration**
   - Try-catch blocks with comprehensive error logging
   - Error classification and appropriate log levels
   - Stack traces for debugging
   - Consistent error response format

5. **Request/Response Logging**
   - HTTP method, path, and query parameters
   - Request headers and body (sanitized)
   - Response status, timing, and payload size
   - Correlation IDs across service boundaries

### Security Implementation

All components must adhere to these security standards:

1. **Authentication**
   - Strong password requirements
   - Multi-factor authentication support
   - Session management with secure defaults
   - Protection against brute force attacks

2. **Authorization**
   - Role-based access control
   - Attribute-based access control where needed
   - Principle of least privilege
   - Regular permission audits

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encryption of sensitive data at rest
   - TLS for all communications
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Protection against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities

4. **Audit and Compliance**
   - Comprehensive audit logging
   - Tamper-evident logs
   - Compliance with relevant regulations
   - Regular security assessments

### API Documentation Standards

All APIs must be documented using OpenAPI/Swagger with:

1. **Comprehensive Schema Definitions**
   - All models with property descriptions
   - Data types and validation rules
   - Required vs. optional fields
   - Example values for all properties

2. **Endpoint Documentation**
   - Complete endpoint descriptions
   - Request parameters and body schemas
   - Response schemas for all status codes
   - Error response details

3. **Authentication Details**
   - Authentication requirements
   - Token formats and lifetimes
   - Permission requirements for each endpoint
   - Rate limiting information

4. **Developer Experience**
   - Interactive documentation UI
   - Try-it-now functionality
   - Code examples in multiple languages
   - Step-by-step guides for common operations
