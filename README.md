# Project Documentation

## Project Overview

This directory contains the documentation, planning files, and requirements for the project. These documents outline the vision, architecture, and technical specifications for implementation.

## Important Documentation Notice

All documents in this directory are the official guidelines and documentation for the project. 
These documents should be referred to consistently during development to ensure compliance with project requirements.

## Documentation Guidelines

When updating these documents, follow these guidelines:
1. **Preservation of Requirements**: Never delete requirements or test cases, even if they are not yet implemented.
2. **Maintain Structure**: Keep the current section structure intact.
3. **Change Tracking**: Document all changes in the DEVLOG.md file.
4. **System Dates**: All dates in these documents must be kept to maintain the project timeline integrity.

## Contents

### Project Requirements

**File:** `project-requirements.md`

This document outlines the comprehensive requirements for the system, including:

- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- Data schema definitions
- Service specifications
- API requirements
- Integration patterns

The requirements document serves as the primary reference for the project's objectives and constraints.

### Project Plan

**File:** `project-plan.md`

This document provides a detailed implementation plan for the system, including:

- Development phases
- Service architecture
- Component interactions
- Implementation priorities
- Technical approaches
- Future expansions

The project plan breaks down the high-level requirements into actionable development tasks.

### Implementation Guides

Implementation guides provide detailed information about specific components of the system:

- **Service Implementation Guide**: Guide for implementing core services
- **Service Deployment Guide**: Guide for deploying services
- **Client Implementation Guide**: Guide for creating clients
- **Testing Implementation Plan**: Strategy and requirements for testing

## Usage

These documents should be referenced when:

1. **Making Implementation Decisions**: Ensure technical choices align with project requirements
2. **Developing New Features**: Understand how components should interact
3. **Creating Test Cases**: Derive test scenarios from functional requirements
4. **Onboarding New Team Members**: Provide comprehensive project context
5. **Planning Sprints**: Prioritize tasks based on the project roadmap

## Document Maintenance

These planning documents should be treated as living documents that evolve with the project:

- Update requirements when new needs are identified
- Refine the project plan as implementation progresses
- Document design decisions and their rationale
- Track changes to initial requirements

### Documentation Maintenance Guidelines

**IMPORTANT**: When updating this README or any project documentation:

1. **Never Delete Unimplemented Features**: Documentation for planned but not yet implemented features must be preserved.
2. **Scope Limited Updates**: Only update sections directly relevant to your specific changes.
3. **Preserve Project History**: Do not remove or substantially alter historical information.
4. **Maintain Document Integrity**: Keep the existing document structure and organization intact.
5. **Incremental Updates**: Add information incrementally rather than replacing entire sections.

Failure to follow these guidelines risks losing critical project requirements and breaking continuity of the development plan.
