## 2025-05-15 - Project Setup and Core Infrastructure
### Developer: [Your Name]

#### Implemented
- Created initial project repository structure
- Set up basic Express.js application
- Configured MongoDB connection with mongoose
- Implemented basic error handling middleware
- Added Winston logger configuration
- Created Docker and docker-compose files
- Set up initial CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

#### Challenges
- Encountered MongoDB connection issues in Docker environment
- Winston logger wasn't properly closing during tests, causing hangs
- Docker container startup order was causing dependency issues

#### Solutions
- Implemented connection retry logic with exponential backoff
- Added explicit logger cleanup function for test environment
- Used Docker health checks and depends_on conditions to control startup order

#### Decisions
- Selected MongoDB for primary data storage due to flexible schema and scalability
- Chose Express.js for API development for its simplicity and extensive middleware ecosystem
- Implemented modular project structure to support future growth
- Adopted comprehensive logging strategy with structured JSON format
- Selected Jest for testing due to its built-in mocking and coverage reporting

#### Next Steps
- Implement user authentication system
- Create core data models
- Develop initial API endpoints
- Expand test coverage for existing components
- Set up Swagger documentation for API endpoints

## 2025-05-20 - Authentication System
### Developer: [Your Name]

#### Implemented
- Created User model with password hashing
- Implemented JWT-based authentication
- Added login, register, and password reset endpoints
- Created middleware for route protection
- Added refresh token functionality
- Implemented comprehensive test suite for auth flow

#### Challenges
- Securing refresh tokens against theft and misuse
- Handling expired tokens gracefully in the frontend
- Managing token revocation on logout and password change

#### Solutions
- Implemented token rotation strategy for refresh tokens
- Added clear error responses for token expiration
- Created token blacklist for revoked tokens with Redis
- Added automatic token refresh mechanism for frontend

#### Decisions
- Selected JWT for authentication due to stateless nature and scalability
- Used bcrypt for password hashing with appropriate work factor
- Implemented short-lived access tokens (15 min) with longer refresh tokens (7 days)
- Added request ID tracking for cross-service authentication flows
- Created comprehensive security logging for authentication events

#### Next Steps
- Implement role-based access control
- Add social authentication options (Google, GitHub)
- Enhance password policies and enforcement
- Create user profile management endpoints
- Implement account lockout for failed attempts

## 2025-05-25 - Core Data Models and API Endpoints
### Developer: [Your Name]

#### Implemented
- Created Resource model with validation
- Implemented CRUD endpoints for resources
- Added filtering, pagination, and sorting
- Created comprehensive test suite
- Added Swagger documentation for all endpoints
- Implemented request validation middleware

#### Challenges
- Complex query filtering with multiple parameters
- Maintaining consistent pagination across filtered results
- Performance optimization for large data sets
- Handling file uploads for resources

#### Solutions
- Implemented query builder pattern for flexible filtering
- Created cursor-based pagination for consistent results
- Added database indexes for frequent query patterns
- Used streaming for file uploads with progress tracking
- Implemented caching layer for frequently accessed resources

#### Decisions
- Used MongoDB aggregation pipeline for complex queries
- Implemented standardized response format for all API endpoints
- Added comprehensive error classification system
- Created middleware for automatic request validation
- Added performance monitoring for database operations

#### Next Steps
- Implement search functionality
- Add advanced filtering options
- Create reporting endpoints
- Implement batch operations
- Add caching for performance optimization

## 2025-05-30 - Testing Infrastructure Enhancement
### Developer: [Your Name]

#### Implemented
- Created comprehensive unit test suite
- Implemented integration tests for all endpoints
- Added end-to-end tests for critical flows
- Set up performance testing framework
- Implemented test data generation utilities
- Added code coverage reporting

#### Challenges
- Maintaining test isolation for parallel execution
- Managing test data for integration tests
- Handling asynchronous operations in tests
- Creating realistic test scenarios for E2E tests

#### Solutions
- Implemented test database isolation with unique names
- Created test data factories with randomized values
- Used Jest's async/await utilities effectively
- Developed scenario-based testing approach for E2E tests
- Added explicit cleanup for test resources

#### Decisions
- Adopted test-driven development for critical components
- Implemented comprehensive test categorization
- Created testing pyramid with appropriate distribution
- Set minimum code coverage requirements (80% overall, 90% for critical paths)
- Added performance benchmarks for key operations

#### Next Steps
- Implement automated security testing
- Add cross-browser testing for frontend
- Create load testing scenarios
- Implement visual regression testing
- Enhance test reporting with custom dashboard
