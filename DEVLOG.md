# Development Log

This document tracks the development progress, challenges, solutions, and important decisions made during the project. All team members should create individual DEVLOG entries following the established format.

## Important: DEVLOG Structure

**Note**: This file serves as a temporary log. For proper documentation, create individual DEVLOG files in the `/project/devlogs/` directory following the format described below.

## DEVLOG Entry Instructions

### File Location & Naming

All development logs should be stored as individual files in the `/project/devlogs/` directory:

1. **File Naming Convention**: `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-category-brief-title.md`
   - Example: `2025-04-20-14-30-enhancement-add-user-authentication.md`

2. **Categories** (included in filename):
   - `feature` - New feature implementation
   - `fix` - Bug fix or issue resolution
   - `refactor` - Code restructuring without behavior change
   - `docs` - Documentation updates
   - `test` - Test addition or modification
   - `perf` - Performance improvement
   - `devops` - CI/CD, deployment, build processes
   - `security` - Security-related changes
   - `database` - Database schema or query changes
   - `ui` - User interface changes
   - `api` - API-related changes
   - `dependency` - External dependency updates

3. **Never Delete Logs**: Old logs should NEVER be deleted or modified once committed

### Entry Format

Each DEVLOG file should follow this consistent format:

```markdown
# [Category] Brief Title

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
**Author:** Your Name

## Changes Made
- Detailed list of changes
- Be specific about files, features, or components
- Include links to relevant PRs or issues

## Decisions
- Document important decisions made
- Include rationale behind choices
- Reference any alternatives considered

## Challenges
- Document any significant challenges encountered
- Describe solutions implemented or proposed
- Note any unresolved issues

## Next Steps
- List planned next actions
- Include any dependencies or blockers
- Reference related future work
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Prompt**: Create DEVLOG entries as soon as significant changes are made
2. **Be Thorough**: Include all relevant details
3. **Be Clear**: Use simple, direct language
4. **Be Factual**: Focus on what happened, not opinions
5. **Link Related Entries**: Reference previous entries where relevant
6. **Include Resources**: Add links to external resources or references when applicable
7. **Capture Context**: Include enough context to understand the entry without requiring other knowledge
8. **One Entry Per Change**: Create separate entries for distinct changes, even if made at the same time
